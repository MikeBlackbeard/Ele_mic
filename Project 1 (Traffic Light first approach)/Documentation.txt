Resistor calculation:

According with the Data sheet for 5mm LED, the Continues Forward Current for the diode is 25mA

The voltage for this project is 5v (Arduino DC voltage)
With this values and Ohmâ€™s law:

R = v/i
R = 5/0.025
R = 200 ohms

To prevent damaging the LEDs for a high current flow we decided to use 220 ohms resistors. boolean 

Class Diagram

Since traffic lights have only two states we decided to use boolean variables

State Machine Diagram

Traffic Lights change in the next order:

Green to Yellow
Yellow to Red
Red to Red and Yellow
Red Yellow to Green

This process continues in an infinite loop.


Pins to use in the Arduino:

output 8 - green
output 9 - yellow
output 10 - red
