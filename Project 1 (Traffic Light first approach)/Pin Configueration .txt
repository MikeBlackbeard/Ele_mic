Digital pins can be used as input and output command via pinMode(), digitalRead(), and digitalWrite().
Every pin has build in resistor which can be controlled by digitalWrite() with a value of high or low. 
The maximum current a pin can consume is 40mA.

Serial number 0(RX) and 1(TX)
-0(RX) is for incoming signal and 1(Rx) is for sending TTL signal data. They both are connected to USB-TTL module .
-They are both pins connected to bluetooth module.

PWM - 3,5,6,9,10,11
-They can send 8bit PWM analog signals and also can send digital signals .

Pin 2,4,7,8,12,13 
-Used for transferring digital signal only 

GND 
- Represents ground and mostly used as the negative for of simple connection.
