Tasks for Lab 3:
Add a bus drive interrupt

A bus driver can extend the green phase of the traffic light by 10 seconds 
If the traffic light is not in the green state it triggers the transition 
from red to yellow and yellow to green faster as in the usual way

Note: the button for the pedestrian has a higher priority than the bus-driver button
