check Leds separately from each other : 

1- Defining the positive side of the led (longer ) and the negative side ,we can check each led via 2 ways :
  A- if we do have a Multimeter , we  connect the positive with Anode probs and the negative led with cathode ,if the led   is working ,it will illuminate and give us a visible light .



 B- Develop a circuit by connecting a 5v battery to the led in serious with resistance :
To calculate the amount of resistance required :


-From the Led data sheet  : I = 25mA , V = 5 v …..

 V = I * R …....Ohm’s law

R = 5*10^3 / 25 = 200 Ohm 




Develop a program to control one led : 

To control a circuit ,we will develop a program on Ardiuno IDE and simulate it on Tinkercard :


-The Led can be controlled by “ Flashing on and off “ after certain time "5 sec" set in the program  

-The led is connected to PIN number 12 on the Ardiuno  the amount of the R =200 ohm as calculated before.

-The program file on IDE is uploaded and has name " one led code.ino"
