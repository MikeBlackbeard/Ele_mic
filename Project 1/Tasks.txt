Main components:

Arduino UNO

3 resistors 220 ohms
3 light emitting diodes (Red - Green -Yellow)
Breadboard
connecting wires

Resistor calculation:

According with the Datasheet for 5mm LED, the Continues Forward Current for the diode is 25mA
The voltage for this project is 5v (Arduino DC voltage)
With this values and ohmâ€™s law:
R = v/i
R = 5/0.025
R = 200 ohms
To prevent damaging the LEDs for a high current flowing we decided to use 220 ohms resistors.

===============================================================================================

1. Develop a circuit

output 8 - green
output 9 - yellow
output 10 - red

Resistors: 220 ohms


===============================================================================================

2. Develop a program

UML model
- Class Diagram:

bool red_light
bool yellow_light
bool green_light

chage_light() function

- State Machine Diagram

Start the Arduino IDE
Which Pins should be used
Configure the Pin configuration
- Develop a program for one LED
- Develop a program for traffic light control
